## Stock Search Responsive Website (Bootstrap, Angular, Node.js, AJAX, JSON, HTML, AWS, REST)
Built a responsive website that performs the operations listed above, allowing users to navigate between different pages for different functionalities and deployed the application on AWS.


## Stock Searcher (HTML, CSS, Python, Flask, Javascript, DOM, JSON, XMLHTTPRequest, AWS)
Created a webpage that allows you to search for stock information using Tiingo API, displays results in tabular and chart format using HighCharts and provides news using News API.
## Grievance Cell (HTML, CSS, PHP, Javascript, SQL, Tomcat, XAMPP)
Equipped undergrad administration with application allowing students and faculty to create accounts, register grievances to improve experience of 90% of users by providing anonyÂ­mity.Reduced time taken to resolve grievance from 2 weeks to 3 days for over 7500 accounts.


## Bilingual Translator - NLP  
Designed an NLP model to translate Telugu-English code-mixed and code-switched utterances to a single language, using data analysis and rules to improve language comprehension amongst the greater population. 


## Part of Speech Tagger (Python) - NLP
Developed a POS tagger using Hidden Markov Model to achieve 93% and 91% accuracy on Italian and Japanese training data and 92% accuracy on Hindi as test data.


## Hotel Reviews Classifier (Python) - NLP
Trained a classifier to determine if hotel reviews are positive or negative, truthful or deceptive using Naive Bayes and Perceptron Classification (Vanilla and Averaged) algorithms.


## Lemmatizer (Python) - NLP
Trained a model to learn lemmatization function from an annotated corpus achieving 95.5% accuracy on Hindi training data and 94.7% on a hidden language.


## Full Name Predictor (Python) - NLP
Developed a rule-based model to predict full name given a pair of related names by reducing ambiguity to achieved 97.5% and 95% accuracy on training and test data.


## Clustering of Countries based on Covid-19 Indicators (Python) 
Clustered 190 countries by performing K-Means algorithm and Expectation Maximization algorithm in GMM on publicly sourced Covid data.
Compared and analysed both results and to find top 5 factors aiding COVID-19 cases and analysed their effects in different countries.


## Enjoyment Predictor (Python)
Built a decision tree from scratch based on six indicators to predict enjoyment of a customer with 90% accuracy.


## Gesture Classifier (Python, Matlab)
Classified gestures as downward or other gestures by back propagation algorithm in Python without using libraries to achieve 88% and 75% accuracy on training and test data respectively.

Converted and improved the model to predict gestures as left, right, palm or peace in any background by using Matlab and achieved 100% and 90% accuracy in training and test data. 


## Word Embedding using PCA and FastMap (Python)
Reduced the dimensionality of 3-D data points and embedded them in 2-D space using PCA, FastMap and plotted the reduced projection coordinates of words into a 2-D plane. 


## Robot Trajectory Predictor (Python)
Predicted the most likely trajectory for a robot in a 2-D grid world with obstacles when locations of towers and noisy distances to each tower by using HMMs built from scratch.  


## Optimal Path Determiner for Mars Rover (Python)
Determined the optimal path for a Mars rover for a  given 3-D terrain with different constraints by modifying Artificial Intelligence algorithms such as A*, BFS, uniform cost search, HMM.
 

## AI agent for Halma Game (Java)
Developed an adversarial game playing agent using Min-max and Alpha-beta pruning algorithms to return next optimal move in a two-player Halma game with time limit.
Reduced number of moves from 200 to 70 to win in 30 out of 50 games with opposing agents.


## Medication Compatibility Predictor (Java)
Implemented an agent to determine compatibility of medicines for people with multiple diseases by using First Order Logic to achieve 90% accuracy.
Structured knowledge base with 100 diseases and medicines in order to detect incompatibility between medications.


## Geospatial Data Handling (PostgreSQL, Google Earth)
Collected geospatial data points in different categories around USC, calculated the convex hull, nearest points, area covered, and spirograph to  plot them onto Google Earth.
